Suppose we have the following code:
public class Foo {
    public Foo() { ... }
    public void first() { ... }
    public void second() { ... }
    public void third() { ... }
}
The same instance of Foo will be passed to three different threads. ThreadA will call first, threadb will call second, and threadC will call third. Design a mechanism to ensure that first is called before second and second is called before third.
