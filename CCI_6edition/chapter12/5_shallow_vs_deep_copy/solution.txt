Deep and shallow copy cannot be discussed without mentioning pointers. When a shallow copy is done a pointers address is assigned to another poitner; notice the data is not copied, only its memory address. With a deep copy all of the data associated with the pointer is copied.

EXAMPLE:
int a = 5;
int b = 9;
int c = 23;
int *d = a;

Shallow copy:
d = b;

Deep copy:
*d = c;


BOOK ANSWER:
This is actually for structs and objects. Shallow copy copies all the member values from one struct/object to another. A deep copy copies the values as oppose to the pointers.
