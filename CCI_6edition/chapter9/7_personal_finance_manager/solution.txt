QUESTION: Explain how you would design a personal financial manager (like Mint.com). This system would connect to your bank accounts, analyze your spending habits, and make recommendations.

Im assuming that the connection to the bank account is not that concerning and that the main issue of the problem is receiving the transaction history from the bank.
