The variability of where the program crashes can be due to a few things:

1. The program is controlling flow with the date and time, thus it crashing at different places when run at different times. To test this, I would run the program with a specific system time, and retry with the same time to see if the issue occurs. If there are variables with dates I would hard code the dates to see if they produce the same result. A particular case of this might be the month in which the program is run with since there are 12 > 10 months.

2. The program is reading and writing to a file, socket, pipe, or stream, so that when it is ran it has different values for its variables. (NOTE: this is most often the case.). If there is an input file, I would copy the input files, run the program, note the output, and then repeat with the contents of the copied input files to see if I get the same result. If the program is reading input from a file where each input is a month it would make sense why its crashing assuming the months in each field were consecutive.

3. Other programs might be filling up RAM memory causing our program to run out of memory to use, so I would just kill those programs if necessary and see how our program behaves.

4. More than one instance of the program might be running, so I would kill past versions and run the program clean.
