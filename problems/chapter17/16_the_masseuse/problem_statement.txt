A popular masseuse receives a sequence of back-to-back appointment requests and is debating which ones to accept. She needs a 15-minute break between appointments and thereforee she cannot accept any adjacent requests. Given a sequence of back-to-back appointment requests (all multiples of 15 minutes, none overlap, and non can be moved), find the optimal (highest total booked minutes) set the massseuse can honor. Return the number of minutes.

EXAMPLE
Input: {30, 15, 60, 75, 45, 15, 15, 45}
Output: 180 minutes ({30, x, 60, x, 45, x, x 45})
