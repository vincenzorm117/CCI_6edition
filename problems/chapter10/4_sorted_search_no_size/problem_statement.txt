You are given an array-like data structure Listy which lacks a size method. It does, however have an elementAt(i) method that returns the lement at index i in O(1) time. If i is beyond the bounds of the data structure, it returns -1. (For this reason, the data structure only supports positive integers.) Given a Listy which contains sorted, positive integers, find the index at which an element x occurs multiple times, you may return any index.
