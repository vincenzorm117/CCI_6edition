A thread is a unit of execution, and a process is a program in execution. A process can have multiple threads, but there is only one program per thread. A thread has a thread id that can be used to stop or start it and multiple threads can work on the same code stack. A process has a process id that can be used to send signals to it such as the kill signal, and processes are not designed to share memory except files.
